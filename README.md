Analyzing NYC Cab Rides with Machine Learning and Tensorflow


### About the Project:

This project is about Forecasting Cab rides in New York City. Interestingly enough, it utilizes Big Query right within the notebook to run some queries and publish results in a pandas data frame, that can easily be used to plot any visualization using matplotlib. 

There are some visualizations included in the project.
